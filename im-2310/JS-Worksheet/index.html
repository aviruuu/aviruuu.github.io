      <h2>Key Terms for Programming with JavaScript</h2>

      <p>
        JavaScript is an object oriented scripting language and as such employs a number of the standard programming features and concepts listed below. All of the 
        following will be discussed in further detail in the sections below but to introduce them quickly:
      </p>

      <h3>Statements</h3>

      <p>The coding equivalent of a sentence – a complete section of code completed with a semicolon that performs an action.</p>

      <p>Statements can vary quite a bit, but a very simple statement might look like this:</p>

      <code>
        x = 16;
      </code>

      <h3>Variables</h3>

      <p>Variables are containers used to store and retrieve values.</p>

      <p>The following two statements define and then set the value of a variable:</p>

      <code>
        let x;
        <br>
        x = 16;
      </code>

      <h3>Functions</h3>

      <p>Functions execute a list of statements, and often they are used to group these actions together in a specific order.</p>

      <p>An empty function might look like this:</p>

      <code>
        function exampleFunction() {
        <br>
        <br>
        }
      </code>

      <h3>Parameters</h3>

      <p>
        One or more comma separated variables that are written in between a function's parentheses. Parameters change how a function works each time it runs. Some 
        functions use parameters, but not all do.
      </p>

      <p>A function with two parameters might look like this:</p>

      <code>
        function exampleFunction(myParameter1, myParameter2) {
        <br>
        <br>
        }
      </code>

      <h3>Block</h3>

      <p>A section of code that is run together – defined by using curly brackets.</p>

      <p>This example function's block includes three separate statements that will then execute in the order written every time the function is run:</p>

      <code>
        function exampleFunction(myParameter1, myParameter2) {
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;let x = myParameter1 + myParameter2;
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;x *= 2;
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;return x;
        <br>
        }
      </code>

      <h3>Objects</h3>

      <p>JavaScript objects are collections of named information which we can use methods to interact with in a range of ways.</p>

      <p>Most types of variables and all HTML elements are objects which allows us to dynamically change them.</p>

      <p>
        In the example below the text value "patrick" becomes an object when it is assigned to myName variable. Once it becomes an object can we then run the 
        toUpperCase() method which will return the text in all caps:
      </p>

      <code> 
        let myName = "patrick";
        <br>
        myName.toUpperCase();      
      </code>

      <h3>Methods</h3>

      <p>
        Methods are built in functions that objects can run – they are used by typing the object name followed by a . and then the desired method and a set of 
        brackets.
      </p>

      <p>These two statements declare myName as a variable and then run the toUpperCase() method on that variable object:</p>

      <code>
        let myName = "patrick";
        <br>
        myName.toUpperCase();
      </code>

      <h3>Naming in JavaScript w/ camelCase</h3>

      <p>
        When naming variables and functions it is standard practice to use camelCase - this refers to a style of writing phrases with multiple words without using 
        spaces. It involves starting the phrase with a lower case letter and using an uppercase letter at the start of each subsequent word - eg: 
        thisIsWrittenInCamelCase.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can choose whatever name you want for variables and functions as long as it doesn't start with a number or match a reserved keyword. Best practice is to be 
        descriptive with your names, for example if I was to write a function that multiplies two numbers together calling it something like multiplyTwo is much better 
        than something generic like myFunction.
      </p>

      <h2>JavaScript and the HTML DOM</h2>

      <p>
        When a browser turns your code into a web page it creates a dynamic model called the HTML DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM takes the form of a tree 
        of objects, as you can see in the image here.
      </p>

      <!-- The image below is from the W3S article JavaScript HTML DOM - https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp -->
      <img src="images/htmltree.gif" alt="A diagram of the document object model">

      <p>As HTML elements in the DOM are objects JavaScript can be used to manipulate them, allowing you to dynamically change web pages.</p>

      <p>For example:</p>

      <p>JavaScript can dynamically change all of the HTML elements on the page.</p>
      <p>JavaScript can dynamically change all of the HTML attributes on the page.</p>
      <p>JavaScript can dynamically change all of the CSS styles on the page.</p>
      <p>JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes.</p>
      <p>JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes.</p>
      <p>JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events on the page.</p>
      <p>JavaScript can create new HTML events on the page.</p>

      <p class="task-highlight">
        <strong>Task:</strong> Try out some basic the examples of manipulating the HTML DOM <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp" target="_blank">here</a>

      <h2>Where Does My Javascript Go?</h2>

      <p>
        Much like CSS, JavaScript can be writen inline in a HTML attribute, internally inside the &lt;script&gt; tag and in external text 
        files with the .js extension.
      </p>

      <p>Here is an example of each, try them out and view the source code of this page to see the differences:</p>

      <h3>Inline</h3>

      <p>The HTML button element below has an attribute called onclick whose value contains a JavaScript statement.</p>

      <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo1').innerHTML = 'Here is some different text!'">Try it</button>

      <p id="demo1">Here is some text.</p>

      <h3>Internal Scripts</h3>

      <p>
        In this example the JavaScript statement is instead declared (defined) as part of a function inside of a &lt;script&gt; tag. I've called this function 
        timeJokeFunction which I can then call by the referencing its name in the button below's onclick attribute.
      </p>

      <script>

        function timeJokeFunction() {
          document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "A waste of time.";
        }

      </script>

      <button onclick="timeJokeFunction()">Try it</button>

      <p id="demo2">What do you call a clock on a persons belt?</p>

      <p>
        Internal &lt;script&gt; tags can be included inside of either the &lt;head&gt; or &lt;body&gt; of the document but will be loaded at different times as a 
        result - choose deliberately.
      </p>

      <h3>External scripts</h3>

      <p>
        Once again we are declaring our JavaScript statement as part of a function but this time that function is written inside of an external JavaScript file. To import
        this file we use the same &lt;script&gt; tag as in the above example except instead of writing our JavaScript directly inside we're importing the external file 
        using the src attribute. Once imported this function can again be called in the same way as our internal script by referencing its name in the button's onclick 
        attribute.
      </p>

      <script src="./buttondemo.js"></script>

      <button onclick="myExternalFunction()">Try it</button>

      <p id="demo3">Is everyone still awake?</p>

      <hr>

      <p>
        It is often convenient to include Javascript inline or internally - however along with making things easier to read and maintain, external scripts can be cached 
        on their own can help speed up page loads.
      </p>

    <section id="statements" class="sections">

      <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

      <p>JavaScript statements are single instructions to do something. Depending on what you're trying to do they might include:</p>
        
      <ul>

        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp" target="_blank">variables</a></li>

        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#data_structures_and_types" target="_blank">values</a></li>

        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp" target="_blank">operators</a></li>

        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#keywords" target="_blank">keywords</a></li>

        <li>and/or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comments.asp" target="_blank">comments</a></li>

      </ul>
        
      <p>While the actual parts may vary they always end with a semi-colon.</p>

      <p>It is common for JavaScript statements to look something like this:</p>
      
      <code>
        // this changes the text inside the element with the id of testID
        <br>
        document.getElementById("testID").innerHTML = "Hello World";
      </code>

      <p>or this:</p>
        
      <code>
        // this returns the value of the variable x
        <br>
        return x;
      </code>

      <p>or this:</p>
        
      <code>
        // this calls the function called myFunction with arguments of 3 and 12
        <br>
        myFunction(3, 12);  
      </code>

      <p>
        Like a sentence in any other language there are many forms the structure or syntax of a statement might take, the important thing is that they express a single 
        instruction, though that instruction might have several stages. While not essential to its operation it is standard practice to end your statement using a 
        semi-colon and to start a new line in your code before starting the next one so you can easily read where one ends and the new statement begins.

      <h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>

      <p>
        JavaScript functions are blocks of code, commonly made up of multiple statements, that 'do' something - once <strong>defined</strong> functions can be 
        <strong>called</strong> as often as you like.
      </p>

      <p>While we can run JavaScript statements by themselves, for example by directly writing them into a HTML event attribute it is also possible to call - load and 
        run - a JavaScript function.
      </p>

      <p>Below is an example of a function definition:</p>

      <code>
        function myExternalFunction() {
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = 'Zzzzz';
          <br>
         }
      </code>

      <ul>

        <li>First we use a keyword to tell the computer that we're defining a function - the keyword is the word function</li>

        <li>
          Next we give our function a name - in this case myExternalFunction. You can call your function whatever you want be each name should be unique in your 
          project.
        </li>

        <li>Next we write a pair of parentheses - if we want to declare some parameters (see below) this is where we'll put them</li>

        <li>Finally we write some curly brackets to define the code block that we want to run when the function is executed</li>

      </ul>

      <p>
        Function <strong>parameters</strong> set what <strong>arguments</strong> the function can receive in the form of <strong>values</strong>, which are then stored 
        as local <strong>variables</strong>. Like the unique name you give your function, parameter's names are chosen by you and can be whatever you like as long as no 
        two parameters share the same name. Functions often don't have any parameters, such as in the examples above, but if they do multiple parameters can be added at 
        the same time by separating them with commas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Functions can also include a <strong>return</strong> statement - in such cases the function will stop when it reaches the return keyword and return a statement 
        to the caller. Again functions often don't have a return statement, it'll depend on the specifics of what you want the function to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        This might seem like a lot of moving parts but it's not so bad in practice - for example, the function written below takes in three separate parameters - 
        <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> - and calculates the result of adding the three parameters together using the <strong>expression</strong> a+b+c:
      </p>

      <code>
        function myCalculator(a, b, c) {
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;return a + b + c;
        <br>
        }
      </code>
      
      <p>  
        Functions like this that use a return statement can be called by declaring a <strong>variable</strong>, which then stores the results and can be used to 
        represent it - using the above function it would look like this:
      </p>

      <code>  
        let c = myCalculator(3, 2, 1);
      </code>

      <p>
        Remember you only ever define each function once using by using the word 'function' - after which you can call that function as many times as you want using its 
        name followed by the <strong>operator</strong> ().
      </p>      

      <p class="task-highlight">
        <u>Task:</u> Both of the buttons below currently have the same addThree function assigned as part of their onclick event. In the &lt;script&gt; tag where 
        addThree is written define a new function that will instead multiply two parameters together and then return the results. This function can be called whatever 
        you like but it will need two parameters when you define it and will need to use the * operator instead of the + operator in its return statement.
        <br> <br>
        To test if it works find the section of the second button's inline JavaScript statement that calls addThree and swap it out for your new function, making sure 
        to update the two argument values to 4 & 3. If working correctly clicking the second button should now return the expected number.
      </p>

      <script>

        function addThree(a, b, c) {
          return a + b + c;
        }

        function multiplyTwo(a, b) {
          return a * b;
        }

      </script>

      <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo5').innerHTML = addThree(3, 2, 1)">Click here to get the result of 3 + 2 + 1</button>

      <p id="demo5"></p>

      <br>

      <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo6').innerHTML = multiplyTwo(4,3)">Click here to get the result of 4 * 3</button>

      <p id="demo6"></p>

      <br>

    </section>


    <section id="variables" class="sections">

      <h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>

      <p>
        A JavaScript variable is an object we can create with its own specific name that can be used as a container to store a value, like some text or a number. 
        Variables need to be defined the first time you reference them using a keyword, in this case let, followed by a unique name of your choice, such as in the 
        example bellow:
      </p>

      <code>      
        let myHairColour;
      </code>

      <p>When defined like this they don't contain any value and when queried will return:</p>
        
      <code>undefined</code>
      
      <p>
        While you can assign them a value in later statements often you'll want to initialise a variable with a value which can be done using the equals operator as 
        seen below:
      </p>

      <code>  
        let myHairColour = "brown";
      </code>

      <p>
        Like functions you can only define variables once, but once you have defined them using their unique name you can refer to them or reasssign their value as much 
        as you want, such as the example below. I'm initialising my variable with the value "brown" then changing it to "blonde" in the next statement (note I only use 
        <strong>let</strong> once when I define the variable, I don't need to use it when I'm changing that variable's value).
      </p>

      <code>
        let myHairColour = "brown";
        <br>
        myHairColour = "blonde";
      </code>

      <p>
        Remember that JavaScript is run sequentially - so if I was to write any new statements in between these two statements they would see the myHairColour as 
        having the value of "brown" and any code written below the second statement would see its value as "blonde".
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
        Variables can store many different kinds of data and allow for different functionality (see methods below) based on what type of data they are storing. We'll be 
        looking at more complex data types and information storage structures later in the semester, for now let's start with the two most basic types: numbers and 
        strings.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Numbers</strong> - Variables can store two types of numbers, whole numbers like 23 (often reffered to as integers or ints) or numbers with a decimal 
        place like 3.142 (often reffered to as floating point numbers or floats). JavaScript will work out which is which when you assign the number to a variable and 
        there are some times where this distinction is important, such as when using an array, something we'll be covering in more detail in week 6.
      </p>

      <code>
        // this is an int variable
        <br>
        let myAge = 34;
        <br>
        // this is a float variable
        <br>
        let coffesDrunk = 1.4;
      </code>

      <p>
        <strong>Strings</strong> - Variables can also store text, called <em>strings</em>, which can be as long or short as you'd like. Unlike numbers strings need to 
        be wrapped inside either single or double quote marks.
      </p>
      
      <code>
        // this is an acceptible string
        <br>
        let myHairColour = "brown";
        <br>
        // so is this
        <br>
        let myEyeColour = 'blue'; 
      </code>

      <p>
        It's good practice to stick to using one or the other type of quote marks for defining strings as sometimes you'll need to nest them. In the example below I 
        wanted to use a string inside of some inline JavaScript but because it's part of an attribute my browser will read the end of the value at the second " it sees. 
        By alternating the type of quotes used the HTML will be able to understand the difference.
      </p>

      <code>
        // this code can read the difference between the string and the attribute
        <br>
        &lt;button onclick="printString('mystring')"&gt;print&lt;/button&gt;
        <br>
        // this code thinks the onclick attribute ends after the (
        <br>
        &lt;button onclick="printString("mystring")"&gt;print&lt;/button&gt;
      </code>

      <h2>JavaScript Objects - Properties & Methods</h2>

      <p>
        In JavaScript an object is a specific data type that refers to a collection of information accessible under a particular name. Variables and HTML elements are 
        the most common type of object you'll deal with as you start to learn JavaScript. The information stored in an object is accessible as a property and they also 
        inherit a number of generic functions called methods. We'll keep it simple to start with when working with objects but we'll dip into some more advanced uses 
        as we progress this semester.
      </p>

      <h3>Object Properties</h3>

      <p>
        As mentioned this is how we access the information stored in an object - in the example below we're able to find the innerHTML property of a HTML element.
      </p>

      <code>
        // this line uses a method (explained below) to find a HTML element in our HTML DOM and then saves that element as a variable
        <br>
        let testObject = document.getElementById("testID");
        <br>
        // this line then finds the innerHTML property of the testObject variable and saves it to its own variable
        <br>
        let testObjectString = testObject.innerHTML
      </code>

      <p>
        As shown here properties are accessed by writing the name of the object follow by a . then the name of the property. In this case the innerHTML property will 
        return whatever is written inside of the element, that might be a string of text or even other HTML elements. All HTML attributes are accessible as properties 
        using the same name as the attribute and there are other useful properties 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element#instance_properties" target="_blank">built in to all HTML element objects</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Object Methods</h3>

      <p>
        JavaScript methods are predefined functions that are stored as a property of a JavaScript object - like functions you might write yourself methods are called 
        by using their name (written in camel case) followed by a set of brackets that may or may not need argument values placed inside. Unlike functions they are can 
        only be called in relation to an object - as shown in the example below this relationship is defined by naming the object first followed by the method with a 
        dot in between:
      </p>

      <code>
        document.getElementById("testID");
      </code>

      <p>
        In this case we are calling the <strong>getElementById()</strong> <em>method</em> on the <strong>document</strong> <em>object</em>. <strong>document</strong> is 
        a predefined object that represents <a href="#dom">the HTML DOM</a> - running the <strong>getElementById()</strong> <em>method</em> on it with an argument value 
        of <em>"testID"</em> will look through each HTML element currently part of the HTML DOM and return the <strong>first</strong> element with an <em>id</em> 
        attribute value of <em>"testID"</em>. By itself this method won't do anything once it finds that element however if we were to add the following:
      </p>
      
      <code>
        document.getElementById("testID").innerHTML = "Hello World";
      </code>

      <p>
        we could change the <strong>innerHTML</strong> <em>property</em> (what's written inside that element) to the text "Hello World" by using the equals operator. .
      </p>

      <p>
        To reiterate the above statement is first calling the <strong>getElementById()</strong> <em>method</em> on the <strong>document</strong> <em>object</em> and 
        then changing the text inside the resulting element to "Hello World" by accessing the <strong>innerHTML</strong> <em>property</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Different objects contain different methods and properties but while starting out using the <strong>getElementById()</strong> <em>method</em> to find an element 
        and then changing that element's properties is one of the most common things you'll want to do.

      <p class="task-highlight">
        <u>Task:</u> Write a new function to change the text below from lower case to all upper case letters.
        <br> <br>
        In the &lt;script&gt; tag below I've already written a statement that retrieves the text string from the &lt;p&gt; tag and saves it in a variable called 
        stringToCapitalise. You'll need to use this variable as an argument so make sure you define your function underneath it.
        <br> <br>
        Once you've defined your function (don't forget to include a parameter) you'll need to write a statement inside its block that will take the parameter and apply 
        the appropriate method to change it to uppercase. 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Useful_string_methods" target="_blank">Here</a> is a list of common methods you 
        can use when working with text strings.
        <br> <br>
        This method will only change the case of the variable not the innerHTML of the &lt;p&gt; so you'll then need to set this property. It's possible to combine these 
        two steps into one statement but if you're have trouble try changing the parameter first then writting a separate statement to change the innerHTML - hint there 
        are other examples elsewhere on this page showing how to change the innerHTML of an element with JavaScript.
        <br> <br>
        Finally once you've finished writing your new function you'll need to attach it to the onclick attribute of the button labeled "Make Upper Case" - don't forget 
        to set the appropriate variable as the argument. If it is all working correctly clicking the button should now change the case of the text.
      </p>

      <p id="lowerCaseString">capitalise me</p>

      <script>

        let stringToCapitalise = document.getElementById("lowerCaseString").innerHTML;
        
        function capitalise () {
         return()
        }
         
        
        
      </script>

      <h2>DOM Events</h2>

      <p>
        JavaScript statements and functions can be executed (called) when an events occurs - this is what happens when a user clicks on a button that has an onclick 
        attribute like in the examples above.
      </p>

      <p>The simple way to do this is by adding JavaScript code to a HTML element's appropriate event attribute (such as onclick).</p>
<!-- !!! line reference -->
      <p>
        This process can also be done in a slightly different manner by using 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#using_addeventlistener" target="_blank">Event Listeners</a> which are 
        a more flexible and powerful way of working with events. We will cover these in more detail later in semester but you can see an example in the source code of 
        this page on line 733.
      </p>

      <p class="task-highlight">
        <strong>Task</strong> - Try adding an event attribute to the &lt;div&gt; below directly below this &lt;p&gt; that changes the background colour from pink to 
        orange when the mouse enters the element.
        <br> <br>
        You'll need to find the appropriate event name from the 
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp" target="_blank">list of events on w3schools</a> and add it as an attribute to the div (remember to 
        add <em>on</em> to the start of the event's attribute name - eg the click event's attribute is named <em>onclick</em> not <em>click</em>). You'll also need to 
        give the attribute a value, in this case the <em>inline</em> JavaScript statement below will do what you need.

        this.style.backgroundColor = 'orange';

      <h2>What Else Can I Do with JavaScript?</h2>

      <p>Lots of things, but here's a few ideas to get you started.</p>

      <h3>Comments</h3>

      <p>
        Like HTML and CSS <strong>comments</strong> should be an essential part of writing with JavaScript. Comments written in JavaScript are marked using // for a 
        single line and /* with */ for multiple lines. See the source code below for an example
      </p>

      <script>
        // this is a single line comment
        /* 
        anything that appears betweeen 


        these
        two is considered a comment too
        
        */
      </script>

      <h3>Get and Display the Date</h3>

      <button onclick="document.getElementById('date').innerHTML = Date()">Get today's date</button>

      <p>The Date() function gets the browser to return the date and time at the user's location.</p>

      <p id="date"></p>

      <h3>Manipulate Media Elements</h3>

      <audio src="sounds/loop.mp3" loop nocontrols></audio>

      <button id="musicOn">Let's have some background music</button>

      <button id="musicOff" style="display:none">Make it stop!</button>

      <p>
        Take a look at the page source to see how the scripting for these buttons works - one is a function connected to an onclick and one is a function connected to 
        an event listener.
      </p>

      <script>

        document.getElementById('musicOn').onclick = function() {
          var backgroundMusic = document.querySelector('audio');
          backgroundMusic.play();
          this.style.display = "none";
          document.getElementById('musicOff').style.display = "block";
        }

        document.getElementById('musicOff').addEventListener("click", function() {
          var backgroundMusic = document.querySelector('audio');
          backgroundMusic.pause();
          this.style.display = "none";
          document.getElementById('musicOn').style.display = "block";
        });

      </script>

      <h3>Hide and Show Elements</h3>

      <div class="accordion" onmouseover="this.firstElementChild.style.display = 'block'" onmouseout="this.firstElementChild.style.display = 'none'">

        [Hover to Read More]

        <div id="myDIV" style="display:none;">

          <p>Here is a div that I am hiding and showing using a JavaScript statement connected to the mouseover and mouseout events via their HTML attributes.</p>

          <p>Notice in the code that I am using a two new things:</p>

          <ol>

            <li>
              "this" which refers to the element the event attribute is connected to, in this case "this" will be the &lt;div&gt; element with the class of 
              "accordion" that the mouseover and mouseout events are attached to using its attributes.
            </li>

            <li>
              "firstElementChild" which gets the first element <em>child</em> inside of the element you are working with, in this case the first element child 
              inside of what's referenced with "this" would be the &lt;div&gt; element with the id of "myDIV"
            </li>

          </ol>

          <p>
            This achieves a similar effect as the CSS that's used to hide/show the navigation menu, but is achieved instead through JavaScript events and 
            inline stlye.
