      <h2> Week 2 Questions </h2>

      <p> 1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </p>
       The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with Justine's Website was the choice of colour scheme. I liked how the background was light yellow and contrasted with the dark green used with text. I thought the colour scheme was quite an interesting choice but really put more emphasis on the main components of the website.

      <p>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</p> 
        My discrete actions were:
        <ol>
          <li>mouse hovering above the heading of the website</li>
          <li>mouse hovering above at all the dark green rectangles</li>
          <li>clicking on the button called "SOUND ON"</li>
          <li>clicking on 'the beetle' rectangle</li>
          <li>clicking on the 'april showers' rectangle</li>
          <li>clicking on the 'knee-flowers' rectangle</li>
          <li>clicking on the 'the Lovefeast' rectangle</li>
          <li>licking on the 'the Lovefeast pt. ii' rectangle</li>
          <li>clicking on the 'kissing in colonialism (after Ocean Vuong)' rectangle</li>
          <li>clicking on the 'delays' rectangle</li>
          <li>mouse hovering over the spinning rectangles in the bottom right corner</li>
          <li>clicking again on the 'april shower' rectangle</li>
          <li>clicking again on the 'knee-flowers' rectangle</li>
          <li>clicking the spinning rectangles in the bottom right corner</li>
        </ol>
        
       
        
     
       
        
        
        
        
    
        
        
        
        

       
      <p>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</p>  
       Looking at the different sequences of flashing words and trying to understand them and the thought behind it. To me they were really random and having all of the boxes change every second seemed to kind of overwhelm me. I tried reading all the boxes at the same time but the more I tried reading them, the more i appreciated the unknown true meaning behind these words.
       
      <p>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</p>
       Clicking on the rectangles was the most common action in my two minute interaction. Since there was so seven of them and that i could click them in any order I chose. I could also choose to click on the boxes again for them to stop and stay stuck on the word that I clicked the box on. The box then swaps colours with the font and changes into green while the font changes to yellow. 
      
      <p>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</p> 
      My impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience is that she is trying to get the user to understand the importance of words. How words form meaning themselves. 

      <p>6) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</p>
      My impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal is through interaction with the 7 poem boxes. Despite, the flashing words not making sense, they still form meaning around it. When you freeze all the boxes, you are able to form a new meaning with all the randoms words you picked. It allows the users to discover new meanings of words themselves and allows them to think and experiment. Through being able to think independently, we can see how words shape meaning.
     
      <p>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</p> 
      My impression of how the experience should be interacted over time would be around 10 to 30 minutes, as many times as the user wants to create new meaning with words. There is no general time because it differentiates with how the user wants to interact with the website. For example, if the user wants to play more with words and keep creating different sentences until they stop on words they are satisfied with and makes sense to them, they will stay there for who knows how long. It depends how deep a user is willing to go.

      <p>8) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</p>
      My impression of how the interactive experience comunicates how it should be interacted with over time is not very clear as the experience is flexible depending on the person a user is. There is no general estimation but it does give the user a very clear idea on how to waste time with the experience.

      <h3> Week 3 Questions</h3>

      <p>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</p>
      A media form that the experience refers to is a type of word game. This is because plays on words and is very easy to interact with. I can see someone playing this when they are bored. This experience can be also for all ages and doesn't appeal to one audience.

      <p>10) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</p>
      This game reference suggest to me that i should have fun and play around with it. There are no rules or anything to follow by so I should have a good time engaging and experimenting with it. It is not mean to frustrate anyone but to be used as a form of entertainment and learning experience.

      <p>11) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</p>
      This game references suggest to me that I should feel happy or in a good mood when engaging with it because its suppose to be fun. Its suppose to make me want to play around with it multiple times until i get sick with it. It is suppose to make me feel that this is an enjoyable experience.

      <p>12) What is the most frustrating element of the interaciton to you and what makes it frustrating?</p>
      The most frustrating element of the interaction to me is how i can't close the boxes because it is hard to focus on all this boxes at once frozen or not. It is an overwhelming experience for me that it frustrates me. I woould like to close the boxes so i can read the independent poems without any distractions.

      <p>13) what is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</p>
      The most satisfying element of the interaction to me is being able to stop the boxes and for the boxes to change colour. It really is aesthetically pleasing to the eye. I really like the colour contrast. I also really find the choice of words satisfying with their position in the boxes and the size of font. Seeing the words flash on the screen is very satisfying as well.
