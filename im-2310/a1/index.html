      <h2> Week 2 Questions </h2>

      <p> 1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </p>
       
      <p id="answer">The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with Justine's Website was the choice of colour scheme. I liked how the background was light yellow and contrasted with the dark green used with the text. The colour scheme was quite an exciting choice but put more emphasis on the main components of the website. I liked the overall aesthetic.</p>

      <p>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</p> 
      <p id="answer"> My discrete actions were:
        <ol>
          <li>My mouse hovered over the title of the webpage</li>
          <li>My mouse hovered above all the individual green rectangles with titles</li>
          <li>I clicked on the button called <strong>"SOUND ON"</strong></li>
          <li>I clicked on the green rectangle titled "the beetle"</li>
          <li>I clicked on the green rectangle titled "april showers"</li>
          <li>I clicked on the green rectangle titled "knee-flowers"</li>
          <li>I clicked on the green rectangle titled "the Lovefeast"</li>
          <li>I clicked on the green rectangle titled "the Lovefeast pt.ii"</li>
          <li>I clicked on the green rectangle titled "kissing in colonialism (after Ocean Vuong)"</li>
          <li>I clicked on the green rectangle titled "delays"</li>
          <li>My mouse hovered  over the spinning rectangles in the bottom right corner</li>
          <li>I clicked again on the 'april shower' rectangle</li>
          <li>I clicked again on the 'knee-flowers' rectangle</li>
          <li>I clicked the spinning rectangles in the bottom right corner</li>
          <li>I started randomly clicking the rest of the rectangles</li>
        </ol> </p>
        
    
      <p>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</p>  
      <p id="answer">I was looking at the different sequences of flashing words and trying to understand them and the detailed thoughts behind them. They were random and having all the boxes change every second seemed to overwhelm me. I tried reading all the boxes simultaneously, but the more I read them, the more I appreciated the unknown true meaning behind these words.</p>
       
      <p>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</p>
      <p id="answer"> <strong>Clicking on the rectangles/ boxes</strong> was the most common action in my two-minute interaction. Since there were seven of them, I could click them in any order I chose. I could also choose to click on the boxes again for them to stop and stay stuck on the word on which I clicked the box. The box then swaps colours with the font and changes to green while the font changes to yellow. 
      </p>
      <p>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</p> 
      <p id="answer">The intended primary goal of the interactive experience is that she is trying to get the user to understand the importance of words. How words form meaning themselves. </p>

      <p>6) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</p>
      <p id="answer">My impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal is through interaction with the seven poem boxes. Despite the flashing words not making sense, they still form meaning around them. When you freeze all the boxes, you can create a new meaning with all the random words you picked. It allows the users to discover new meanings of words and will enable them to think and experiment. Through being able to think independently, we can see how words shape meaning.</p>
     
      <p>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</p> 
      <p id="answer">My impression of how the experience should interact over time would be around 10 to 30 minutes, as often as the user wants to create new meaning with words. It differentiates how the user wants to interact with the website. For example, if the user wants to play more with words and keep creating different sentences until they stop on terms they are satisfied with and makes sense to them, they will stay there for who knows how long. It depends on how deep a user is willing to go.</p>

      <p>8) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</p>
      <p id="answer"> My impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time could be more precise as the experience is flexible depending on the person a user is. There is no general estimation, but it does give the user an apparent idea of how to waste time with the experience.</p>

      <h3> Week 3 Questions</h3>

      <p>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</p>
      <p id="answer">A media form that the experience refers to is a type of word game. It plays on words and is very easy to interact with. I can see someone playing this when they are bored. This experience can also be for all ages and doesn't appeal to one audience. </p>

      <p>10) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</p>
      <p id="answer"> This game reference suggests I should have fun and play with it. There are no rules or anything to follow, so I should enjoy engaging and experimenting with them. It is not meant to frustrate anyone but to be used as a form of entertainment and learning experience. </p>

      <p>11) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</p>
      <p id="answer">These game references suggest I should feel happy or in a good mood when engaging with it because it should be fun. It's supposed to make me want to play around with-it multiple times until I donâ€™t enjoy playing it anymore. It is supposed to make me feel that this is an enjoyable experience. </p>

      <p>12) What is the most frustrating element of the interaciton to you and what makes it frustrating?</p>
      <p id="answer">The most frustrating element of the interaction for me is how I can't close the boxes because it is hard to focus on all these boxes at once, frozen, or not. It is an overwhelming experience for me, and it frustrates me. I want to close the boxes to read the independent poems without distractions. </p>

      <p>13) what is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</p>
      <p id="answer">The most satisfying element of the interaction to me is being able to stop the boxes and for the boxes to change colour. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye. I really like the colour contrast. I also find the choice of words satisfying with their position in the boxes and the font size. Seeing the words flash on the screen is very satisfying as well. </p>
